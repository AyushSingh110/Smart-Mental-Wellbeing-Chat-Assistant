Title: Thought Record Worksheet
Category: Cognitive Restructuring

Overview:
A thought record is a structured CBT tool used to examine and challenge negative automatic thoughts.

Steps:
1. Identify the triggering situation.
2. Write the automatic thought.
3. Identify the associated emotion (rate 0–100% intensity).
4. List evidence supporting the thought.
5. List evidence against the thought.
6. Create a balanced alternative thought.

Why It Works:
Negative emotions are often intensified by distorted thinking. By analyzing evidence objectively, emotional intensity often decreases.

Therapeutic Goal:
To develop balanced, realistic thinking patterns.
