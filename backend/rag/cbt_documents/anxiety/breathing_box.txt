Category: Anxiety Grounding

Overview:
Box breathing is a structured breathing technique designed to regulate the autonomic nervous system. It is frequently used in CBT and stress-reduction programs to manage anxiety and physiological arousal.

When to Use:
- During panic symptoms
- Before stressful events
- When experiencing muscle tension
- When feeling emotionally overwhelmed

Steps:
1. Inhale slowly for 4 seconds.
2. Hold the breath for 4 seconds.
3. Exhale slowly for 4 seconds.
4. Hold again for 4 seconds.
Repeat for 5–10 cycles.

Why It Works:
Slow, controlled breathing stimulates the parasympathetic nervous system, which counteracts stress activation and lowers heart rate.

Therapeutic Goal:
To restore calm physiological balance and reduce anxiety symptoms.
