Title: 5-4-3-2-1 Grounding Exercise
Category: Anxiety Grounding

Overview:
The 5-4-3-2-1 grounding technique is a sensory-based intervention commonly used in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy to reduce acute anxiety and interrupt panic cycles. It helps redirect attention from distressing internal thoughts to the present physical environment.

When to Use:
- During anxiety or panic episodes
- When experiencing racing thoughts
- When feeling overwhelmed or overstimulated
- Before sleep if the mind feels restless

Steps:
1. Identify 5 things you can see around you.
2. Identify 4 things you can physically feel or touch.
3. Identify 3 things you can hear.
4. Identify 2 things you can smell.
5. Identify 1 thing you can taste.

Why It Works:
Anxiety activates the body’s fight-or-flight system, pulling attention toward imagined threats. This exercise shifts awareness to neutral sensory input, helping calm the nervous system and reduce physiological stress activation.

Therapeutic Goal:
To anchor awareness in the present moment and decrease emotional intensity.
