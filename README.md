🧠 Smart Mental Well-Being Assistant

An AI-powered mental health support assistant designed to understand emotional signals from user conversations and provide supportive responses while tracking a Mental Health Index (MHI) to monitor well-being trends.

The system integrates machine learning models, behavioral analysis, conversational AI, and safety mechanisms to deliver empathetic support while detecting potential high-risk situations.

🌟 Key Capabilities

The assistant is designed to act as a supportive conversational companion that can:

🧠 Detect emotional signals from text
⚠️ Identify potential crisis or self-harm risk
📊 Track mental health trends over time
💬 Generate supportive conversational responses
🚑 Escalate to crisis resources when necessary

Unlike traditional chatbots, this system evaluates multiple psychological indicators simultaneously to produce a more realistic well-being assessment.

📊 Mental Health Index (MHI)

The Mental Health Index (MHI) is a score between 0 and 100 representing a user's overall mental well-being based on conversation analysis.

Score Range	Category
80 – 100	🟢 Stable
65 – 79	🟡 Mild Stress
45 – 64	🟠 Moderate Distress
25 – 44	🔴 High Risk
0 – 24	🚨 Crisis Risk

The MHI is updated after each conversation message using multiple signals.

🧩 AI Signal Analysis

To evaluate mental health signals, the system combines several independent analysis modules.

🧠 Emotion Detection

Identifies emotional tone in user messages.

Possible emotions include:

sadness

anxiety

anger

joy

neutral

This is implemented using a fine-tuned DistilBERT transformer model.

⚠️ Crisis Detection

Detects potential self-harm or suicide risk from conversation text.

The system outputs a probability score:

crisis_score ∈ [0,1]

If the score exceeds a defined threshold, safety protocols are triggered automatically.

🧍 Behavioral Signal Detection

A rule-based behavioral analysis detects patterns such as:

social withdrawal

loss of motivation

substance coping

hopelessness language

sleep disturbance

These signals contribute to the behavioral risk score.

📋 Psychological Screening

The system integrates validated screening tools:

• PHQ-2 – depression screening
• GAD-2 – anxiety screening

Scores are normalized and incorporated into the overall risk calculation.

📈 Historical Trend Analysis

The assistant analyzes previous conversations to identify trends.

Recent sessions are weighted more strongly using exponential decay, allowing the system to detect:

improving mental state

declining mental state

stable trends

🧮 Mental Health Matrix

All signals are combined using a weighted scoring model.

Inputs:

emotion_score
crisis_score
behavioral_score
screening_score
history_score

These signals are processed by the Mental Health Matrix, which produces the final Mental Health Index (MHI).

💬 Conversational AI Support

The assistant generates supportive responses using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

Response generation considers:

user message

detected emotion

conversation intent

current MHI score

crisis probability

The assistant aims to:

validate user emotions

suggest coping strategies

encourage reflection

guide toward professional help when needed

🛡️ Safety Layer

Safety is a core design principle.

The Safety Service ensures responses remain responsible and supportive.

It performs:

• crisis response override
• response validation
• helpline insertion
• emergency escalation

If severe distress is detected, the assistant bypasses the language model entirely and returns crisis support guidance.

🎤 Voice Interaction

The assistant supports speech-based interaction.
